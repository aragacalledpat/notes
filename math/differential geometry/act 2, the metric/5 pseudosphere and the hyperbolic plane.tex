\title{5 - Pseudosphere and the hyperbolic plane}

\begin{andrew_section}{Belatrami's Insight}
    \item 
        two areas of discovery were reaching a head at the same time.
        hyperbolic geometry by lobachevsky, and gauss' differential geometry.
        both around 1830.
    \item 
        1868, belrimi thought there might be a connection. hyperbolic
        geometry was 40 years old and obscure.  [in some way, this makes
        sense to me- he was legit just denying one of the euclidean axioms
        and showing it produced cool stuff].
    \item 
        beltrimi reasoned via the local gauss-bonnet theorom
        that if he found a surface of constant negative curvature
        it would obey the laws of hyperbolic geometry.

\begin{andrew_section}{The Tractrix and the pseudosphere}
    \item 
        psuedosphere has this constant negative curvature, but it has
        a boundary...which is something of a problem because the hyperbolic
        plane was conceived to be infinite
    \item 
        \emph{tratrix}, investigated by newton.  imagine a table (axes X and Y),
        with a paper weight on it, and a string of length R attatched to it.
        the other end of the string touches the end of the table.  drag the
        string around the \emph{edge} of the table. curve the weight makes
        is a tractrix.  the weight will hypothetically never reach the 'Y-axis'.
    \item 
        let $\sigma$ represent the arc length, so $\sigma=0$ would be
        before you start pulling the string at all.  [nifty triangle similarty
        argument between delta sigma/-delta X and X/R...second triangle being
        the big one made by the string and distance from Y axis, first one
        obviously being infinitesimal]: \\ $X = Re^{-\frac{\sigma}{R}}$
    \item 
        pseudosphere is the surface of revolution for a tratrix
\end{andrew_section}

\begin{andrew_section}{A Conformal Map of the Pseudosphere}
    \item 
        need to create a conformal map from pseudosphere to $\mathbb{C}$.
        let x be the angle and sigma the arc length of the tractrix.
        so $(x,\sigma)$ will be sent to $x + yi$
    \item 
        a few considerations lock you into the bounded circle approach.
    \item 
        generators are orthogonal so the mapping must be orthogonal.
    \item 
        take a circle around the pseduosphere of sigma = constant.  this
        circle will have a radius X.  now take a triangle of two lines Xdx,
        $d\sigma$, because of the metric, this has to be shrunk to a trianle of
        lines dx dsigma.
    \item 
        the map is $d\hat{s} = \frac{R ds}{y}$, where $ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$
